testimonial2:
  - I love these lunch boxes! Our school asked that we start packing a placemat with our lunches, but it was hard to find one that folded up that small and they would always come back filthy. FlatBox is much more durable than any other lunch box we've had (I have 3 boys).

testimonial3:
  - My three-year-old can open and close this lunch box herself. With her food allergies, we use FlatBox to ensure her food doesn't touch the table and her space at the preschool lunch table is clearly marked. It holds a lot more food than I expected too. I love that it's machine washable!

testimonial5:
  - Love, love, love this lunch bag!! Bought one to see if liked it and I will definitely be purchasing another one! FlatBox holds plenty of food for an adult lunch, looks good, zips and closes easily, and keeps your lunch from being scattered on dirty tables. I've gotten a lot of compliments!

testimonial6:
  - My teenager loved the cool design. I love that I can wash FlatBox in the washing machine! I could never get his other lunch boxes clean enough. Stuff always getting in the cracks and crevices and a hard type of lunch box just didn't work for school. I think this one will finally be the one!

  - These lunch boxes are AWESOME!! My son has used FlatBox for the last few years. It is the perfect size for me to send plenty of food for his lunches. They really are fantastic!

testimonial8:
  - The lunch bag is well made and packs easier than the old standard square lunch bag. I bought FlatBox because I eat at my desk most of the time, and I was tired of getting crumbs in my keyboard or dropping salad oil on documents. The zippers glide easily and it stores nicely since I can lay it flat. I love this bag.
